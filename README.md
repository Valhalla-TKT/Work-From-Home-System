## Coding Standards
### Java Class Format
- Use CamelCase for class names (e.g., `UserService`, `CourseController`).
- Class names should be nouns and should represent a single responsibility.
- Class files should be named after the class they contain, with the file extension `.java` (e.g., `UserService.java`).

### Method Format
- Use camelCase for method names (e.g., `getUsers()`, `calculateProgress()`).
- Method names should be verbs or verb phrases, indicating actions performed by the method.
- Methods should have clear and concise purposes, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.
- Methods should be properly documented using Java-doc comments to explain their purpose, parameters, and return values.

### General Coding Standards
- Follow the Java coding conventions outlined in the Oracle Java SE Coding Conventions.
- Use meaningful variable names that reflect their purpose.
- Limit the length of lines to 80-120 characters to ensure readability.
- Write modular and reusable code to promote maintainability.
- Utilize appropriate design patterns and best practices where applicable.
